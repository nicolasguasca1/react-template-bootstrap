This is the prototype of an application that follows the MERN stack path. The NodeJS server is intended to be in charge of doing not only the database queries but also the routing for SSR. Use the following approach to get the app up and running locally:

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/nicolasguasca1/tripool`. Make sure you have Git installed on your system.
2. Install the packages by running `yarn install` on both "server" and "UI" folders. Make sure you have Yarn installed on your system.
3. Look for the root of the project in the terminal and run `mongo`. Make sure you have already download MONGODB shell on your system. You can run the command `show dbs` to check tha databases registered in the system.
4. Go to "server" folder and run `yarn dev`. This will trigger the NodeJS server on the port that is set up.
5. Go to "UI" folder and run `yarn start` to see the application front-end running in the browser.

Start to develop :)
